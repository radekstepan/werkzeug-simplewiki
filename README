`simplewiki`
    A simple Wiki implementation.

    Requirements:
    -   SQLAlchemy
    -   Markdown
    -   genshi

    You can obtain all packages in the Cheeseshop via easy_install.  You have
    to have at least version 0.7 of Creoleparser.

    Usage::

        ./manage-simplewiki.py initdb
        ./manage-simplewiki.py runserver

    Or of course you can just use the application object
    (`app.SimpleWiki`) and hook that into your favourite WSGI gateway.
    The constructor of the application object takes a single argument which is
    the SQLAlchemy URI for the database.

    The management script for the devserver looks up the an environment var
    called `SIMPLEWIKI_DATABASE_URI` and uses that for the database URI assuming
    it reflects the relative sqlite db path in the root directory of the project.
